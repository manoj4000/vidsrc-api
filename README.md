- Added stable fixes for most of the sources so it wont break too often.
- Everything Works currently and the speed has also increased in the latest commit dut o use of non-blocking async functions.
- Still the code may have some bugs,so feel free to post bugs in the issue section :)

A simple web scrapper based on this [resolver](https://github.com/Ciarands).

## About

- Deploying
  
    Project specifically made to run on vercel,but easy to deploy on other platforms.Just check the running fastapi on the specific platform.

    `IMPORTANT `: Vercel is facing a bug recently so setting node version to `18.x` is a fix for it.
  
    *_there's an detailed explanation in this issue [link](https://github.com/cool-dev-guy/vidsrc-api/issues/12#issuecomment-2032147362)_
- Running it locally

  1.Fork and Clone the repo.
  
  2.Create a virtial env if you want.

### FEATURES
```
- async support - Most process are async but still some fixes are needed.
- very fast results
- subtitle support for every sources.
```
### NOTES
```
- Dont overload the deployment.
- This api is made for educational purpouse only. This is just a simple scrapper built arround `https://github.com/Ciarands` vidsrc downloader.This project was only made to prevent ads and redirects caused by the `iframe`s
- This api isnt a copy of the inspired project,but its a complete reqrite of code to make it work as an api and use async style to give vary fast results.
- Dont perform bulk request to the api and store the m3u8's returned,cuz they may not work after 24 hours or so.This api scrape websites that have `video on demand` feature so storing it is useless.
```
